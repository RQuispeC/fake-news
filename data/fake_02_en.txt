Aécio cries a lot and is afraid to go to jail. Ricardo Noblat, in his column at Globo, reported that Aécio Neves cried a lot to learn that the 1st class of the STF decided to keep his sister, Andrea Neves, arrested.

People close to the senator said he's untrained and too afraid to be arrested. Next Wednesday (20), the same class that decided to keep Andrea arrested will judge the request for imprisonment (made by PGR) against Aécio Neves. It is noteworthy that if the request is approved, the Senate will still have to authorise the arrest of the parliamentary.

Andrea Neves is considered the intellectual mentor of the political career of the Toucan and was ready to undertake flight to England when it was captured by Operation Patmos of the Federal police.

Aecio's world has literally collapsed. According to Veja magazine, the politician does not want to talk to anyone [...] attends very few calls on his cell (something obvious, since the device is stauned by PF) and has alternated between crying crises and several ' talagadas ' of whiskey.
