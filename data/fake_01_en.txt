Katia Abreu says she will put her expulsion in a frame, but does not quit complaining.

Senator Katia Abreu (without party-to) said her expulsion from the PMDB was the result of an action from the current dome of the legend, which she says is opportunistic.

"Tomorrow I will put in a golden frame my expulsion, because of the hands where it came from, is a certificate of good conduct for my resume. These people who kicked me out, they don't serve the country. They serve the country in their own benefits, "said Katia Abreu.

But if expulsion is such a good thing for your resume, why so much crying, Katia?

We know why. Probably Katia has no value for the PT, a party that should already have absorbed it. It seems the PT liked Katia only if it was entrenched inside the PMDB.

I mean, that's too much of a demote. Katya remains crying the Pitanga everywhere.

In time: So far the PT has not registered Katia Abreu in their ranks. What a pathetic situation for the former minister of Dilma's agriculture.
